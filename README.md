# KQL for Garmin Data

KQL queries for Garmin data exports. You can import the Garmin .csv to either https://aka.ms/KustoFree or Log Analytics in Azure.

There's already a bunch of KQL queries in the KQL folder. 

Think of something that doesn't already exist in the folder, make a request and I'll work on it.

Eventually - once there's plenty of data views - I want to create and provide a full dashboard.
